Instructions
------------

On Unix, the Protobuf configure script needs to be run before running 
CMake in order to create the config.h file:

   $ cd /path/to/protobuf
   $ ./configure

The CMake variable PROTOBUF_ROOT needs to be set to the location of
the Protocol Buffers sources. When running CMake on the command line,
this can be set like this:

   $ cd build
   $ cmake /path/to/protobuf-cmake -DPROTOBUF_ROOT=/path/to/protobufs
